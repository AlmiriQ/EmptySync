# EmptySync
Minecraft mod for inventory sync
Works on Fabric 1.20.4 but may be compiled with any other versions I think.

It's kinda alpha so your inventory can disappear ðŸ‘€

This mod need an EmptySyncCore running somewhere. When you have a sync core specify it in `empty-sync.json` file like that:
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 2222
}
```
